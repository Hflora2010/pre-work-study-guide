        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>Is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>Made up of elements which work together to provide content and makeup the skeleton/framework of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements are case sensitive.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about the element.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined at the beginning of an element, never the closing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization.</li> 
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization.</li>
          <li>CSS defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page.</li>
          <li>Three CSS style options include: inline, internal CSS Style sheets and external CSS style sheets.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is styling an element directly in the HTML file applying to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS Style Sheets contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file—rule only applies to that page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs which are used to identify elects in the page code.</li> 
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets is the most common and allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a separate file— which makes design changes easier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git clone [url] retrives an entire repository from a hosted location via URL.</li>
          <li>git add -A stages the changes, indicating to git that we want to save the changes to that file.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive</li>
          <li> JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Examples of variable types include: String, Number, Boolean, Array and Object.</li>
          <li>Operator: a mathmatical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Examples of operators include: Addition, Subtraction, Miltiplication, Division, Assignment, and Strict Equality.</li>
          <li>Conditionals: Structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. Most common is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Function is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionally that you wish to reuse. Good uses when repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>Use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>For loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a rask on all itenms in an array but allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>For loops contain 3 parts: keyword 'for', three-part conditional statement, and code block.</li>
          <li>Function is different from a conditional statement and a for loop because it doesn't automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
          <li>You must call a function by name in order for it to be executed.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Control flow dictates that JavaScript files are execute from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes the code inactive without deleting it, just incase you need it later.</li>
